# C++ Programming Course Repository

This repository contains a collection of C++ programming assignments and projects completed during my university coursework in Algorithm and Programming and Advanced Algorithm and Programming.

## Contents

This repository covers a wide range of programming concepts and algorithms, including:

- Basic programming fundamentals
- Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions and procedures
- Arrays and matrices
- File handling
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
1. Document my progress and learning journey in C++ programming
2. Serve as a reference for fundamental C++ concepts and algorithms

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference. However, please note that this repository is primarily for educational purposes and to demonstrate my understanding of C++ programming concepts.

## Note

If you're a student, please use this repository responsibly and avoid direct copying for your own assignments. Understanding and implementing these concepts yourself is crucial for your learning and growth as a programmer.

## Contact

If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the implementations, feel free to reach out to me.
